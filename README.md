## 👨‍💻 About Me

Final semester **Software Engineering** student at **King Saud University** who builds and ships real products that people actually use. I don't just code—I architect solutions, solve impossible problems, and turn ideas into live applications.

**What sets me apart:** I ship fast, iterate faster, and know that every tool has its place. Whether it's bypassing university Wi-Fi restrictions with Cloudflare Workers or building AI systems that remember context across conversations, I find the elegant solution.

🎯 **Currently:** Seeking high-impact Co-op opportunities where I can contribute to production systems and scalable architectures.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🛒 **KSUMarket** — Verified Student Marketplace
<img align="right" width="100" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/100+-Users-success?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white"/>

A production marketplace exclusively for King Saud University students. Buy, sell, and trade within a verified, trusted environment.

**The Problem We Solved:** Firebase was completely blocked on KSU Wi-Fi. Most teams would give up. We designed a proxy architecture using **Cloudflare Workers** as a middleware layer between the Flutter app and Firebase services—ensuring reliable on-campus connectivity.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter (iOS & Android)
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions, Storage, Analytics)
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Workers (Proxy Layer), Cloudflare CDN
- **Architecture:** Custom proxy pattern for restricted network environments

**Impact:** 100+ active verified students, seamless transactions, zero downtime on campus.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> **"Every tool contributes to the complete picture. I choose the right one for the job."**

I believe in building systems that are:
- **Simple but not simplistic** — Elegant solutions to complex problems
- **Fast but not fragile** — Performance without compromising stability
- **Beautiful but not superficial** — Design that serves function
